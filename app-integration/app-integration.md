# App Integration

Shopify allows you to enhance the functionality of your store through apps. Apps can help you with a wide range of tasks, including managing products, optimizing SEO, improving customer experience, and automating processes.

**App integration** with the Shopify Customizer allows third-party apps to add features and settings directly into the store's theme layout. This enables store owners to customize the appearance and functionality of these app features without needing to edit any code.

### **Install the App**

{% hint style="success" %}
* Go to the Shopify App Store from your **Shopify admin panel.**
* In your admin panel, select **Settings**, and then choose **Apps and sales channels**
{% endhint %}
