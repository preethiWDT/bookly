# Creating Collections

Collections in Shopify allow you to group products into categories or themes, making it easier for customers to browse your store and find related items.&#x20;

For example, you can create collections like **"Summer Clothing," "Best Sellers," or "On Sale.**

### **Types of Collections in Shopify**

* A **Manual Collection** requires you to **individually add products** to the collection.
* It gives **full control** over which products appear.

{% hint style="success" %}
[Creation  product](../product/creating-products.md) should be linked after creating collection
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Go to** Shopify Admin > **Products > Collections**.
* Click **Create Collection**.
* Enter a **Title** and **Description**.
* Under **Collection Type**, select **Manual**.
* Click **Save** and then manually add products.
{% endhint %}

### **Automated Collections**:

* An **Automated Collection** uses **rules and conditions** to dynamically add products.
* Products that match the set conditions are **automatically included** in the collection.
