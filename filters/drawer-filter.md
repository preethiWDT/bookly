# Drawer Filter

A **Drawer Filter** in Shopify refers to a filtering system that is displayed in a sidebar on the left or right side of a collection or search page. This layout is one of the most common designs for e-commerce stores as it allows for multiple filtering options to be shown simultaneously without taking up too much horizontal space.

### **Steps to Enable vertical Filters in Shopify**
