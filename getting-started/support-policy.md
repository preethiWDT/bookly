# Support Policy

We are committed to providing exceptional support and look forward to assisting you to the best of our abilities. This support policy details the level of assistance you can expect from us.

By using our Shopify themes, you agree to this support policy. We reserve the right to amend our support policy at any time without prior notice.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Support Policies :** A supported item includes item support for **6 months** from the purchase date. During those 6 months, we are expected to be available to provide the item support services. You’ll also have the option to purchase extended item support, increasing the item support period up to a maximum of 12 months from the date of purchase.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We **do not** provide support for **Envato element subscription** users.

If you need support from us, then you need to buy the theme from Themeforest, else you can refer our theme documentation to fix your query.
{% endhint %}
