# Selectors (Language & Currency)

### Currency Selector

Shopify now allows stores to allow customers to shop and check out in their local currency. This is a very positive thing because buyers are much more likely to have a good experience shopping in their own currency and finalize their purchase knowing that they will not incur any additional fees from their bank.
