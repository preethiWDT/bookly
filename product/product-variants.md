# Product Variants

In Shopify, a product variant is a version of a product that has specific attributes, such as size, color, material, etc. Variants allow you to sell a single product in multiple forms, helping customers choose the exact option they want.

**Note :** Variants are based on options, which are characteristics of the product (e.g., size, color). Each product can have up to 3 options (e.g., Size, Color, Material).
